# LangFuse Example Repository

This repository contains examples and utilities for working with langfuse to monitor applications using large language models (LLMs). It demonstrates how to interact with LLMs for various use cases, including simple API requests, chat-based interactions, and using LLMs as evaluators or judges.

## Features

- **Simple API Requests**: Examples on how to make basic requests to LLM APIs and monitor their responses.
- **Chat Interactions**: Implement and monitor chat-based workflows with LLMs for conversational applications.
- **LLM as a Judge**: Use LLMs to evaluate data or make decisions, and monitoring to ensure accuracy and consistency.
